## Open-source Software: Voyant Tools

[Voyant Tools](https://github.com/sgsinclair/VoyantServer) is an open-source web-based text analysis platform designed for digital humanities research. It allows users to upload text collections and explore them through interactive visualizations such as word clouds, frequency graphs, and concordance tables. The goal of Voyant Tools is to make text analysis accessible to scholars, students, and educators without requiring programming knowledge. The project promotes transparency and collaboration in the digital humanities community by providing openly available source code.v
